• admin.py is a configuration file for the built-in Django Admin app
• apps.py is a configuration file for the app itself
• migrations/ keeps track of any changes to our models.py file so our database and
models.py stay in sync
• models.py is where we define our database models, which Django automatically
translates into database tables
• tests.py is for our app-specific tests
• views.py is where we handle the request/response logic for our web app

After creating an app add it tp INSTALLED_APPS from settings.py
urls.py -> link between view and template
